## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/datadragon.git
   cd datadragon
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your Salesforce credentials and settings
   ```

## üìã Prerequisites

1. **Salesforce Connected App**: Create a Connected App in Salesforce with OAuth settings:

   - Callback URL: `http://localhost:3000/oauth/callback`
   - OAuth Scopes:
     - Access and manage your data (api)
     - Perform requests on your behalf at any time (refresh_token, offline_access)
     - Access custom permissions (custom_permissions)

2. **Event Log File Access**: Ensure your Salesforce organization has Event Monitoring enabled and your user has permissions to access Event Log Files.

3. **Permissions**: Your authenticating user needs:
   - "View Event Log Files" permission
   - "API Enabled" permission
   - Access to User and UserLogin objects

## ‚ö° Usage

1. Update your `.env` file with your Salesforce Connected App details and configure user targeting:

```
SF_LOGIN_URL=https://yourorg.my.salesforce.com
SF_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CONNECTED_APP_CONSUMER_KEY
SF_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_CONNECTED_APP_CONSUMER_SECRET
SF_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3000/oauth/callback

# For a small number of users, list them directly in the env file
TARGET_USERS=user1@example.com,user2@example.com

# For many users, create a CSV file and reference it
USERS_CSV=target-users.csv
```

2. For large user lists, create a CSV file (default: `target-users.csv`):

```csv
email
user1@example.com
user2@example.com
user3@example.com
...
```

3. Run DataDragon:

```bash
npm run wake-dragon
```

4. DataDragon will:
   - Open a browser window for SSO authentication with Salesforce
   - After successful authentication, display a success message (you may close the browser window)
   - Load users from the CSV file or environment variable
   - Fetch User and UserLogin data to determine which days to scan
   - Download and analyze relevant EventLogFiles
   - Generate reports in the project directory

## üìä Output Files

DataDragon produces the following output files:

- **output/tokens.json**: Cached authentication tokens
- **output/summary-report.json**: JSON data that could be used for generating additional reports
- **output/summary-report.csv**: CSV report of all detected risks with detailed context information

The CSV report includes:

- User activity information
- Detailed risk context
- Login patterns
- Risk factors explanations
- Specific event details for each warning

The CSV report is designed for easy import into spreadsheet applications for investigation and analysis.

## üß† Enhanced Risk Assessment System

DataDragon uses a sophisticated risk assessment system that prioritizes critical security events while avoiding false positives:

### Risk Scoring Methodology

1. **High-Priority Events**: Certain events automatically trigger critical or high risk levels:

   - **Critical Risk Events** (150 points):
     - Report Exports (direct data exfiltration)
     - Organization Data Exports (complete org data extraction)
     - Bulk API Requests with large record counts (mass data operations)
   - **High Risk Events** (100 points):
     - LoginAs (admin impersonation)
     - Direct Apex Execution (system manipulation)
     - Permission Set Assignment (privilege escalation)
     - API Anomalies (platform-detected issues)

2. **Standard Security Warnings**: Other security events add points based on severity:

   - Critical: 50 points
   - High: 30 points
   - Medium: 15 points
   - Low: 5 points

3. **Login Anomalies**: Unusual login patterns also add to the risk score:
   - Rapid IP changes: 25 points (high severity)
   - Unusual login hours: 15 points (medium severity)
   - Weekend activity for weekday-only users: 5 points (low severity)

### Risk Level Assignment

Risk levels are assigned using both event types and cumulative scores:

1. If ANY critical events are detected ‚Üí Automatic "critical" risk level
2. If ANY high-risk events are detected ‚Üí Automatic "high" risk level
3. For other cases, score-based thresholds apply:
   - 100+ points ‚Üí Critical
   - 75-99 points ‚Üí High
   - 50-74 points ‚Üí Medium
   - 21-49 points ‚Üí Low
   - 0-20 points OR no warnings/anomalies ‚Üí None

This approach ensures critical security events receive immediate attention while minimizing false positives.

## üîç Complete Risk Detection Patterns

DataDragon monitors for the following types of suspicious activity:

| Event Type                  | What's Detected                          | Risk Level | Rationale                               |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| ReportExport                | Report Export                            | Critical   | Every export is a potential data exfiltration risk |
| DocumentAttachmentDownloads | Document Download                        | Critical   | Every download is a potential data exfiltration risk |
| ContentDocumentLink         | Excessive Internal Sharing (>20/hour)    | Medium     | May indicate staging for exfiltration   |
| ContentDistribution         | Public Sharing Activity (>5)             | Critical   | Significant data exposure risk          |
| Login                       | Multiple IP Logins (>3)                  | High       | Could indicate compromised credentials  |
| LoginAs                     | Admin Impersonation                      | High       | Admin impersonation warrants review     |
| Sites                       | Internal Access via Guest User           | High       | May indicate misuse of public access    |
| Search                      | Excessive Search Activity (>100/hour)    | High       | Bulk reconnaissance activity            |
| ApexCallout                 | High Volume External Callouts (>30/hour) | High       | May indicate external data exfiltration |
| VisualforceRequest          | Possible Page Scraping (>100/hour)       | High       | Possible scraping or automation         |
| AuraRequest                 | Excessive Component Loading (>200/hour)  | High       | Possible scraping (Lightning)           |

| AsyncReportRun              | Background Report Execution              | Critical   | Every background report is a potential data staging risk |
| FlowExecution               | Manual Flow Trigger                      | High       | Direct process manipulation             |
| ApexExecution               | Direct Apex Execution                    | Critical   | Possible direct manipulation or abuse   |
| ApexTriggerExecution        | Apex Trigger Spike (>150)                | Medium     | Unusual mass-trigger events             |

| BulkApiRequest              | Bulk API Usage (>10)                     | Medium     | Mass data operations through API        |
| PermissionSetAssignment     | Permission Changes                       | High       | Possible privilege escalation           |
| LightningError              | Unusual Error Rate (>30)                 | Medium     | May indicate attempted exploitation     |
| LogoutEvent                 | Unusual Logout Pattern (>15)             | Low        | May indicate session harvesting         |
| DataExport                  | Organization Data Export                 | Critical   | Every org data export is a critical security event |

Special detection is applied for:

- All report exports (immediate critical risk)
- All document downloads (immediate critical risk)
- All background report executions (immediate critical risk)
- All organization data exports (immediate critical risk)
- Sensitive file type downloads (pdf, xlsx, docx, csv)
- Password-less public shares
- Suspicious rapid IP location changes
- Admin page access
- Critical flow or Apex execution
- Bulk operations with large record counts

## üõ°Ô∏è Advanced Configuration

### Custom Risk Thresholds

You can create a `risk-config.json` file to override default risk thresholds:

```json
{
  "ReportExport": {
    "threshold": 1,
    "severity": "critical"
  },
  "DocumentAttachmentDownloads": {
    "threshold": 5,
    "severity": "high"
  }
}
```

### Command Line Options

DataDragon supports several command line options:

```
--debug           Enable debug logging
--days=7          Only scan logs from the last 7 days
--config=path     Specify a custom risk config file
--output=path     Custom location for output files
```

## üîç Security Investigation Best Practices

1. **Protect Your Credentials**: Keep your `.env` file secure and never commit it to version control
2. **Focus on Critical Findings**: Prioritize critical and high severity issues
3. **Investigate Context**: Use the detailed context in the CSV report to understand each security event
4. **Correlate Events**: Look for patterns of activity across multiple event types
5. **Review Login Patterns**: Examine unusual login times or locations that coincide with security events

## üêâ Project Structure

DataDragon is organized in a modular structure:

```
